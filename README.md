# Semantic Version

This lib was created to provide some helpful functions when you want to get the highest or lowest version among a list of versions.

- `GetLessVersion(versions ..string)` will give you the lowest version among the items
- `GetLatestVersion(versions ..string)` will give you the latest version among the items
